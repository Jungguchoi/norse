Beginner tutorials
==================

Below is a set of tutorials and examples that should get you started with the library.
We recommend starting with the `Spiking Neural Networks example <https://norse.ai/docs/auto_examples/plot_mnist.html>`_ 
if you have not worked with `Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network>`_ before.
